CS 5460 - Parallel and Distributed Computing
Lab 2 (Task Queues)
* Part 1: Template for master-worker computation
* Part 2: Using the Template
* Part 3: Select your own problem

This lab uses the Message-Passing Interface to create an API for master-worker computation. We'll create and implement the API, use it to compute an example problem (prime factorization), and then create and compute a task of our own.
